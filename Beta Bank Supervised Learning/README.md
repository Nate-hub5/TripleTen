# Problem Description:

Beta Bank is experiencing gradual customer attrition, and retaining existing customers is a higher priority than acquiring new ones. Our goal is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank based on their past behavior, enabling proactive retention strategies.

# Project Instructions: 

**1.Initialization:** Set up the environment by importing the necessary libraries and preparing for analysis.

**2.Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Load the dataset, inspect it for missing values, adjust column data types, and drop irrelevant or redundant columns.

**3.Class Imbalance Analysis:** Assess the balance of target classes and train an initial model without addressing the class imbalance.

**4.Improving Model Performance:** Enhance the modelâ€™s performance by applying techniques to address class imbalance, such as oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting.

**5.Model Optimization:** Experiment with different models and hyperparameter tuning to identify the best-performing model.

**6.Model Evaluation and Testing:** Validate the final model's performance on the test set and assess its ability to generalize to unseen data.

**7.Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings and evaluate the project outcomes.
