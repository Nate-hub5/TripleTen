These are some of my projects from the TripleTen Data Science course

1. Beta Bank Supervised Learning project is looking at customer churn. We want to understand whether a customer will leave the bank based on each clients past behaviors.

2. Ice Video Game EDA was a simple EDA that looked at video games over a period of time. Our goal was to help plan the 2017 campaign for the company.

3. Interconnect Final Project is looking at customer churn. The goal is to find clients that plan on leaving, and offer promotional codes / offering special plans.

4. Machine Learning for Text is looking at movie reviews. We want to understand the positive from the negative reviews.
