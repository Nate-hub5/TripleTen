These are some of my projects from the TripleTen Data Science course

1. Beta Bank Supervised Learning Project: This project focuses on customer churn. The goal is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank based on their past behaviors.

2. Ice Video Game EDA: A simple exploratory data analysis project examining video games over time. The goal was to help plan the company's 2017 campaign.

3. Interconnect Final Project: This project focuses on customer churn. The aim is to identify clients likely to leave and offer them promotional codes or special plans.

4. Machine Learning for Text: This project analyzes movie reviews to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.
